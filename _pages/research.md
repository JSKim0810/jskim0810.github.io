1. Synthetic mechanism of metal nanoclusters
Metal nanoclusters have gained tremendous interest due to both their atomic precision and molecule-like optical properties. To produce nanoclusters with high uniformity, it is important to identify the synthetic mechanisms of metal nanoclusters thoroughly in the molecular-level. We investigate the synthetic mechanisms of thiolate-protected Au nanoclusters with a special focus on analyzing the metal-ligand complexes. Understanding from these studies can be used to synthesize nanoclusters composed of various metals such as Ag, Pt, Pd, and Rh.
