I study interpretable human-AI interaction for computer vision and machine autonomy. I am also interested in understanding various human-centric properties of current AI models beyond their accuracy, such as <a href="http://cnnlocalization.csail.mit.edu/">explainability</a>, <a href="http://netdissect.csail.mit.edu/">interpretability</a>, <a href="https://genforce.github.io/higan/">steerability</a>, <a href="https://metadriverse.github.io/metadrive/">generalization</a>, and <a href="https://decisionforce.github.io/HACO/">safety</a>. Some of the earlier works I co-authored are <a href="http://cnnlocalization.csail.mit.edu/">Class Activation Mapping (CAM)</a>, <a href="http://places2.csail.mit.edu/">Places</a>, <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/datasets/ADE20K/">ADE20K</a>, <a href="http://netdissect.csail.mit.edu/">Network Dissection</a>. 

See <a href="https://metadriverse.github.io/">MetaDriverse</a> for recent work on machine autonomy and <a href="https://genforce.github.io/">GenForce</a> for recent work on generative modeling.
