I study synthetic mechanism of various nanomaterials ranging from 1 nm-sized metal nanoclusters to Î¼m-sized assembly of nanoparticles. I also focus on understanding structure-property relationship of optically active nanomaterials, such as metal nanoclusters, metal chalcogenide quantum dots, and perovskites.
